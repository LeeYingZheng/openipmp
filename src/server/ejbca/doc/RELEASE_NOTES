EJBCA V1.1

Upgrading from version 1.0:

If upgrading from version 1.0 the database tables need to be migrated if the
DN attributes L or ST have been used. This is because the ordering of those
attributes have changed (for string matching the order must be defined).

If L or ST have not been used in DNs, migration is NOT needed.

What need to be done are to:
1. Read column with DN to me migrated from table.
2. Run 'newDN=CertTools.stringToBCDNString(oldDN)'.
3. Update column with DN in table.

Columns that need updating are:
issuerDN in table CRLData
subjectDN, issuerDN in table CertificateData
subjectDN in table UserData.

If a tool is needed to perform the migration, please contact us.
