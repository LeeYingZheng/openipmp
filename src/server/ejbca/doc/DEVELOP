CertificateStore/Publisher architecture
---------------------------------------

The CertificateStore/Publisher architecture is defined by the two interfaces
IPublisherSession and ICertificateStoreSession:

public interface IPublisherSession;
public interface ICertificateStoreSession extends IPublisherSession;

The CertificateStoreSession is the primary storage
for certificates and CRL. The CA always puts certificates and CRLs in the
CertificateStoreSession session bean defined in ca/ejb-jar.xml. The
CertificateStoreSession is also used to retrieve and find certificates,
retrieve CRLs, check for revocation etc. the CertificateStoreSession implements
the interface ICertificateStoreSession.

Certificates and CRLs can also be published to any number of other certificate
stores, which are defined by session beans PublisherSession1, PublisherSession2,
etc. A PublisherSession is a simple subset of the CertificateStoreSession and
can only be used to store certificates and CRLs. PublisherSession's implement
the interface IPublisherSession.

The IPublisherSession is a simple interface which is only used to store a
certificate or a CRL.
The ICertificateStoreSession extends the IPublisherSession interface with
capabilities to find certificates and CRL etc.
A class implementing the ICertificateStoreSession interface can thus also be
used a PublisherSession and a class implementing the IPublisherSession can
easily (well maybe not so easily) be extended to a fully fledged
CertificateStore.

This architecture gives us the choice of for example an SQL database aa
CertificateStoreSession where we also publish certificates to an LDAP directory,
or the LDAP directory as the primary CertificateStoreSession where we also
publish certificates to a specific SQL database for a specific purpose.
