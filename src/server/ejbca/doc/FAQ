---------
Q : What applications servers do EJBCA run on?

A : As of version 1.3, EJBCA is tested in JBoss and Weblogic.

-----
Q : What databases do EJBCA support?

A : EJBCA supports in theory any database that works with the application
server. The database must have support for long fields, a CRL can in theory
become very large.
EJBCA has as of version 1.3 been tested with MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and
InstantDB. Other databases should work woth simple configuration.

-----
Q : When using JDK 1.4.x i get a java.io.InvalidClassException?

A : Since JDK 1.4 introduced incompatibilities during class serialization the
PublicKey
class used as parameter to some versions of the 'createCertificate' method can
not be
passed correctly.
You must use JDK 1.4 on both server and client, then it works.

-----
Q : Why are there two versions of all commands, i.e. 'ra.sh' and 'ra.cmd'?

A : 'ra.sh' is for UNIX and 'ra.cmd' for Windows.

-----
Q : Why do I get the exception/error:

User foo has status '40', NEW, FAILED or INPROCESS required.; nested
exception is: javax.ejb.EJBException: null

A : When using the LocalAuthenticationSession (default) all users have a STATUS.
The status lifecycle beginns with NEW and ends with REVOKED. Only when the
 status is
NEW, FAILED or INPROCESS is it possible to issue a certificate to a user. After
 a certificate has been issued, the status is set to GENERATED. This works like
 a
 one-time-password scheme. To issue a new certificate to the user his/her status
 must be
 reset to NEW, FAILED or INPROCESS.
This can be done with:

ra.sh/cmd setuserstatus <username> <status>

Status '10' is NEW. Just enter 'ra.sh/cmd setuserstatus' to see a list of all
 status codes.

-----
Q : How do I manipulate keystores using Suns 'keytool'?

A : EJBCA use PKCS12 format for the keystore because it is a standard, and I
like
 standards.
Normally keytool (e.g. sun) can read PKCS12 file but not write, so the
 BouncyCastle JCE is needed to handle PKCS12 keystores.

Put the BouncyCastle provider 'jce-jdk13-<version>.jar' in 'jre/lib/ext', the
 default classpath for extensions in java.

Now it should be possible to run:

keytool -list -alias privateKey -keystore server.p12 -storetype PKCS12
 -storepass foo123 -provider org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider

It should be possible to import etc as well using keytool.

-----
Q : How do I make a keystore using keytool with a real certificate from EJBCA?

A : First generate a new keystore and a keypair:

keytool -genkey -alias mykey -keystore myks.jks -keyalg RSA -dname
 c=SE,O=AnaTom,CN=Test -keypass foo123 -storepass foo123

You SUN keystore is now in the file 'myks.jks'.
Next generate a certification request (PKCS10):

keytool -certreq -alias mykey -sigalg SHA1WithRSA -file myreq.p10 -keypass
 foo123 -keystore myks.jks -storepass foo123

You now hav the certification request in the file 'myreq.p10'.

Open up EJBCA request page in your favorite browser,
 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/apply/request/index.html', and select the link for NOT
 having a browser, 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/apply/request/apply_man.jsp'

Download the Root CA certificate by clicking on the link. Save the certificate
 as 'ca.pem'.

Enter the username and password of a valid user with status NEW, see question 2.
Copy and paste the contents of the certification request, 'myreq.p10' into the
 text field.
Save the returned certificate as 'cert.pem'.

Import the Root CA certificate into the keystore 'myks.jks':

keytool -import -alias cacert -file ca.pem -keystore myks.jks -storepass foo123

Import the certificate reply into the keystore:

keytool -import -alias mykey -file cert.pem -keystore myks.jks -storepass foo123
 -keypass foo123

Now you can take a look at your SUN keystore with:

keytool -list -keystore myks.jks

In theory, you can use the same method with a BouncyCastle PKCS12 keystore by
 adding the following
arguments to every command above:

-provider org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider -storetype PKCS12

unforturnately a bug in keytool prevents this from functioning properly at the
 moment, therefore I
recommend using the 'ca.sh/cmd' to create PKCS12 keystores. It can be used to
 create keystores generally,
not just for CAs.

-----
Q : What aliases do a EJBCA keystore contain?

A : The keystore EJBCA uses is a PKCS12 keystore. The CAs private key and
certificate is cotained in the alias 'privateKey', as configures in
'src/ca/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml'.

If the CA is not a Root CA, i.e. the certificate in alias 'privateKey' is
signed by another certificate, that CA certificate (Root certificate) is
conatined in the alias with the same name as the CN part of the Root CAs DN,
i.e. the CN part of the issuer DN from the certificate in 'privateKey'.

-----
Q : Why does the first function in 'dist.html', fetching a users certificate
 return an error 404?

A : You have specified a subject DN to which no certificates have been issued.

-----
Q : Is EJBCA compatible with another JCE apart from BouncyCastle (for
example Cryptix)?

A : No, this is beacaues only BouncyCastle contains classes to actually generate
certificates and CRLs. Normal JCE only allows usage, not creation.

-----
Q : Where is logging performed and how do I control it?

A : Logging is done using Log4j. Anything below DEBUG level is considered
important information. Logging in JBoss is configured in 'log4j.properties' in
the JBoss config directory.
