The code of EJBCA is under the GPL license (see LICENSE-GPL or

The use of interfaces of EJBCA is under LGPL license (see LICENSE-LGPL or
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.html).

This means specifically that:
Tools, code and libraries (JARS) themselves is under GPL.
Using interfaces to create own modules and modifying the deployment descriptors
to use these modules falls under LGPL.

For example creating a new MyAlgSigningSession (implementing interface
ISignSession) instead of the EJBCA RSASigningSessiom, deploying
MyAlgSigningSession in another JAR and modifying
src/ca/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml to use the new MyAlgSigningSession falls under LGPL.
Another example falling under LGPL is where a custom AuthenticationSession is
created (implementing interface IAuthenticationSession) and src/ca/META-INF/ejb-
jar.xml is modified to use the custom authentication module.

Any modification to java code which is part of EJBCA falls under GPL.
